### Disclaimer- To run the project you need **Ethers in Ropsten network in your Metamask wallet**

## Introduction
Remember the hassle of On-Arrival VISAs or carrying 3 years' worth of income tax reports. The pain when they ask you for your Aadhar Card, your Birth Certificate, and god knows what else.
You fearing to upload your IDs because you're scared of the fact that it might fall into wrong hands.

With **UniChain** there is no hassle of carrying multiple IDs along with you. Just have your UniChain ID and authorize governments as well as third-party vendors and only then allow them to access your data. 

## About UniChain
UniChain is a single global mono-auth management application with the power of blockchain to make this process simpler and faster for humans worldwide, significantly reducing the requirement for paper documents and countless ID cards that an individual has to carry.

UniChain is a PWA implemented with the power of Ethereum test-net Ropsten along with IPFS that digitalizes your priceless documents in a secure and decentralized manner. 

TL;DR: Unique way of Securing Data Privacy using Blockchain 
Tech


## Features
- Unique Global Identity of the user
- Secure and handy storage of valuable documents
- Get Notified whenever somebody accesses your data
- No Central Authority
- Access your information anywhere, anytime
- Self help library to get the latest updates
- Clean and Futuristic UI

## Applications
- All of us carry some of the other documents with us whenever we go somewhere. From going in your car to going to an airport, we carry some kind of ID to authenticate ourselves. Having multiple IDs for multiple situations creates a hassle. UniChain solves it in a secure and decentralized way. Just carry your UniChain ID and show it to the organizations who ask for it and you're good to go. As simple as that. To apply icing on the cake, there is no central authority that keeps hold of your data, it lies along with millions of other files in the IPFS.
- Documents and banks go back way long. How many times have we left and gone back just because we forgot that one document? UniChain solves it. Store all your documents in your UniChain and give them your UniChain ID and boom, you're all set. Even if you want a bank to not access your data, revoke their access and they cannot view your documents anymore.


## Marketing and Business model
- We plan to follow a Social Business Model. An operating strategy to create the intended impact. This includes the organizationâ€™s internal structure as well as external partnerships.
- We plan on creating a brand value of UniChain and partner later with companies to spread awareness about privacy and data security.

## Future Works
- Integration of Artificial Intelligence to deal with KYC and legitimacy of the documents uploaded by the users.
- Bringing UniChain to users even without the intermediate role of Metamask.


## How it works

1. Switch to PWA view on your desktop
2. Install Metamask wallet extension
3. Load some faucet Ethers in the Ropsten test-net
4. Allow UniChain to access Metamask
5. You're now all set to play around with your own UniChain
